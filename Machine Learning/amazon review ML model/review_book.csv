"Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2017",BobHBobH,yes,yes,The plastic handles aren't nearly as durable as the titanium blades.,"I like to have scissors in a kitchen drawer, in my desk drawer, in my nightstand, in the bathroom, in the garage, in my storage shed, in my Winnebago -- well, you get the idea. These seemed like the perfect solution -- good scissors at a low price. Well, it's been three months and they work just fine, but I discovered the other day that the plastic covering the handle behind the hinge on the pair in the kitchen draw is broken. I don't know how it happened, but I don't recall trying to cut anything other than the plastic bags that my prescriptions come and similar materials. No cardboard or rugs or sheet metal -- nothing other than lightweight materials that you'd expect to cut with any ordinary pair of scissors. I tried to return them, but the Amazon website says that they're no longer eligible for return. I'll try something else next time.Updated, 3/12/17: My wife tried to trim some threads on the edge of an old dish towel this morning and the second pair of scissors broke into two pieces when the plastic holding the pivot screw snapped. As you can see from the picture, the plastic holding the blade is also cracked. I guess the titanium blades would still make pretty good ice pics, but when was the last you needed a pair of ice pics?",2,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71JnVJGVhEL.jpg , https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71boTaBICcL.jpg",-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1I8FL1KSHVCMD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000P0LNRE,B000P0LNRE,"Style: 8"" All Purpose 2-Pack"

Well, I was hopeful about these, what could go wrong with titanium blades right? Well, as I quickly found out, a lot. So I take scissors out of the package, and proceeded to cut the package of the other item on my order. It was a simple plastic package, and without offering any resistance one of the blades simply came of, broken in two pieces. A piece of the plastic encasing of the handle also chipped and broke. So I am returning these and back to square ZERO, trying to find a pair that works.This pair had potencial, the yellow grip inside was comfortable. Pair was light weight.

"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2022",RAFAEL A GONZALEZ L,yes,yes,The Best Scissors for Light to Medium Use Available Anywhere,"These Westcott scissors are perhaps far better than any other brands I have tested, and I have been through practically every one over the years (e.g. Fiskars, Scotch, TRU RED, Office Depot, and many generic brands). They cut through materials such as thin cardboard, plastic cards, and paper easily. However, from time to time, I get bad pairs right out of the box with bumps across the blades which makes for a rather poor cutting experience (i.e. the scissors don't feel smooth when opening and closing them). I recommend using a small amount light machine oil in the fulcrum area to keep them working like new. Also, wiping the blades down with a dry or mildly wet microfiber cloth helps remove any debris that can gum up the blades. I am surprised that the company does not recommend taking these measures as they can extend the life of the scissors.Rubbing alcohol will cause permanent stains on the metal, so I would recommend not using it on the blades. Contrary to the company's advertising, these scissors wear out rather quickly if frequently used for cutting tougher materials such as thick cardboard like the one found in shipping boxes. These are not quite industrial-strength scissors but should cut through most light and medium materials without any trouble. I would not recommend using these particular scissors to cut tape and other adhesive. The chemicals found in adhesive remover substances can stain the blades and ruin their precision but if it’s at all necessary to use adhesive remover, use it sparingly; Goo Gone is ideal for these situations being a light enough formula that removes adhesive without damaging metal and plastic surfaces like those found in these scissors. The lighter, drier, and less sticky the materials that are cut with these scissors are, the better for extending these scissors’ useful life.",5,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3RYU0QQ0FL7SK/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000P0LNRE,B000P0LNRE,"Style: 8"" All Purpose 2-Pack"

"Reviewed in the United States on July 10, 2020",Thom,yes,yes,These are not good- just don't do it.,"There's something wrong with the manufacture of these scissors.  The quality control just isn't there at all.  If you're willing to file burrs off the blades and sharpen them, fine then- go ahead.  But, frankly, for just a few coins more you can get a better pair from Fiskars in the same format- but those have smoothly operating blades (these don't) and much more comfortable handles (these are oddly shaped- which at these dimensions can be problematic.)Seriously- I thought I'd forgotten how to use scissors at first as they weren't cutting tissue.  (Tissue!)  Turns out it was some defects on the blades that were keeping them apart- a little microfile action and they work well enough (just stick in some spots still- not smooth.)

"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2023",Robert James,yes,yes,Inferior to the same exact scissors made several years ago,"I just returned some Amazon Basics scissors because the grind on the blades was so course you couldn't slide the blade across any material (see below). I have an old pair of Westcott Titanium scissors, the exact same as these here bought several years ago, and the grind is finer on the blades of the old pair and therefore the blades glide across materials very smoothly. These older scissors still cut well.The new ones do not slide as you cut very well at all. Because of the course grind, they hang up. Try cutting a paper towel in half by first folding the paper towel in half and creasing them and then sliding the scissors up into the fold and cut that way. You will see how the new scissors catch onto the paper and don't slide as you cut thru that fold. The old scissors glide by with no friction at all. That is because they used a fine grind on the blade. You can see the grind marks. I compared the new with the old. The new has courser grind marks. I'm sure it's cheaper to do it that way.I'm normally generous with my reviews and give 5 stars as much as I can.

I have purchased them a few times and have given them as gift to people who create arts and crafts or do sewing projects. The quality of the scissors is very nice. The price on Amazon can range from $5.98 to $15.98 for the same scissor. It tends to shoot up and down. If you watch, you can get this scissor for around $6 dollars. That is when I've been able to get a few. While it is worth $15, not everyone has the money to pay fifteen bucks for a pair of scissors.

"Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2021",V M.V M.,yes,yes,You’re only as strong as your weakest link.,"I won’t lie: I used these scissors for a lot of heavy-duty paper, laminate, and fabric stuff, and these scissors have been through hell and back. Which is okay—when you advertise your scissors with durable materials like “titanium,” there’s an implicit assumption that these scissors can handle tough jobs. The good: they didn’t dull, they were comfortable enough. However, their fatal flaw is the center screw holding the whole thing together—it’s made of what appears to be plastic! That made the entire thing utterly unusable, which is a pity, because I quite enjoyed them.

Look elsewhere.,"I rarely leave reviews, but these scissors are atrocious in terms of quality, and hopefully I can save some other folks the hassle. I have two pairs. Both exhibit cracking in the plastic. One pair gets very light use and will probably be fine for a while. But the pair that got daily use - nothing crazy, just normal cutting of packages, etc - just totally fell apart. The plastic is just cheap and brittle.The blades seem fine, though if they'd dulled in the time we had them, that would have been a surprise. But the lack of overall durability with basic use is truly shocking.

The only thing I would like is to have the blades be a bit longer. They are pretty short, somewhere around 3.5 inches. If they were 5 or 6 inches, these would probably be the only brand of scissors I would buy.

"Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2017",My Opinion,yes,yes,Work well in light duty applications,"Short and sweet, I continue to purchase these scissors for us in my business.For most day-to-day applications, the scissors work very well and hold up.  These applications may be your typical opening of a box, package, etc.  The scissors are very sharp and maintain a nice cutting edge; I have yet to see the two halves separate or develop gaps.The only issue I run into is when they get into heavier duty situations.  I use these in our cable assembly business for cutting thicker items (heatshrink, heavy duty metal tapes, and so on).  Typically I see broken handles after two to three (2 - 3) months of use.  Again, this is heavy duty application.All-in-all, the Cost-Benefit is still there; the cost of the scissors versus how they cut and the initial quality makes them a continued buy for me.

I took a closer inspection to find there is a gap between the blades on both of them. I thought maybe I could do something to bend it straighter and looked at youtube videos for it, but realized it's more trouble than it's worth, since it's possible to break them when done incorrectly. Even if it had a bolt to adjust the tension, I still wouldn't bother to mess with it--I shouldn't have to do anything to it to make it function at its highest regard.. It did cut but it is worse than dollar store scissors! So I just gave up and decided to return them.

The micro tips really are sharp. I’m adding stars.After using old, dull child-style scissors for my craft work, I splurged and expected these to be superior. You know how with expensive scissors, you can just feel as the blades slice past each other that they're honed fine and the slice will be smooth. These are just kind of clunky. Maybe they're not broken in yet or need oil or something, but the slice is not smooth and swift. Also, what does ""micro tip"" mean? On mine it seems to mean that the very tips of the blades are curved slightly toward each other, which makes the scissors ""jam"" when I'm cutting something all the way through to the tips. I had guessed it meant that the very tips would be even MORE precise and useful for detail work than the rest of the blades. That's not happening. I'm not going to bother returning these for $5, but it irks me that I could have bought a big multi-pack of scissors for a few dollars more, and I bet one of them would have been actually sharp.
