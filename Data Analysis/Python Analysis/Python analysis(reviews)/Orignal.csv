Today I received my dog chew and upon opening it smelled VERY STRONGLY of mildew. I noticed a spot on it about the size of a pencil eraser that was off color, but didn’t look like mold.  I immediately went online to return it and found out that it is not returnable. I contacted customer service and they said that due to the nature of the issue they would refund the amount paid. Thank goodness I noticed the smell before giving it to my dog!!  I’m gun-shy now so I went to get one at my local Pet Smart (absolutely no scent and same price) They told me that they would refund if there were any issues with it.  I think I am going to stick with buying these at Per Smart from now on because I won’t have a day or two delay if there is an issue.  My dog loves these by the way.

"Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2024","Customer Review","yes","yes","My Choco Lab Found Nirvana (Thanks to a Cheesy Brick from the Himalayas?) ️","Forget your downward dog yoga poses, folks. My chocolate lab, Saint, achieved true canine enlightenment thanks to this little brick of cheesy goodness from the Himalayas (seriously, it looks like something Indiana Jones would find in a temple).Saint's a notorious chewer. Tennis balls? Gone in 60 seconds. Squeaky toys? Last about as long as a politician's campaign promise. But this yak cheese chew? Oh, honey, this is a whole different ball game.Here's why it's 5 stars (and Luna's official ""paw"" of approval):Durability that puts diamonds to shame. Saint gnawed, chomped, and even tried to bury this thing (because apparently, cheese treasure needs hiding?). Three days later, she's still at it, and the chew barely looks like it's been touched.Calming effect worthy of a Dalai Lama. No more bouncing off the walls like a furry pinball. This yak chew has Saint in a state of zen focus, meticulously chipping away at her cheesy Everest. I swear, I can hear tiny ""om"" chants coming from her.All-natural goodness that even picky pups approve. No weird chemicals or mystery ingredients – just yak milk goodness. Luna's sensitive tummy is doing a happy dance, and her breath actually smells like...cheese? Weird, but somehow endearing.The bottom line: This Himalayan yak chew is like a chewable meditation retreat for your dog. It's quiet, it's long-lasting, and it turns your furry hurricane into a contented cheese sculptor. If you're tired of the constant toy carnage, give this a try. Just be prepared for some serious cheese-induced zen vibes around the house.Namaste, fellow dog owners. ‍♀️Bonus tip: If you're feeling adventurous, try microwaving the leftover bits for a few seconds. Saint goes absolutely nuts for the crunchy, puffed-up cheese nuggets. Just don't blame me if your dog starts demanding yak cheese souffle for every meal.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LPZQ6L6HAS2Q/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B081LYFK6W","B001J9SUHG","Flavor Name: Cheese | Size: 3.3 Ounce (Pack of 1)"

I don't review anything unless I really love it or I really hate it and I'm telling you I love best and highly recommend it especially for younger dogs who are teething or dogs that you when they're bored. I've had a lot of dogs in my life and I really wish this product has been around for all of them.Literally just now as I'm writing this review my 4-year-old said ""Mom, Mako is biting me and I'm watching my show!!"" and since I know that means he's just teething and wants somebody to play with, I just gave him the bone and now he's laying on the couch next to him, chewing something other than my children and will be completely content for at least 20 minutes.These last like 2 weeks in our experience, you can see in the picture I took the last two bones that were chewed down to the last little nub and he still likes to chew on them every once in awhile but was super excited when I got a new one.My pup prefers the peanut butter or bacon flavor and again make sure it says hard on the front of the package before you buy because not all of the available flavors are the same hardness level. We are on number five now for our 16 week pup, all ordered from Amazon and I have yet to have any of them chip or seen any Pieces come off that could be dangerous to my puppy. It isn't smelly AT ALL and it doesn't stain furniture or have any greasy residue. Usually I just see what looks like little white pencil shavings left behind which I just vacuum up.

What is strange about this batch is that it smells like chemical. Bummed out. I will see if I can return but my dog wont touch it.earlier review: Bought the hardest chew for my 15 lb mix. She is small but she is a hard chewer with exceptionally large canines. She can eat through a collagen bone and bully stick in no time. This chew lasts a long time and doesn't smell. She wasn't really interested in it at first but once I soaked it in some water for 5 mins, it softened it enough to get her taste buds interested and then she was in chew mode for an hour. She is a trauma rescue and nothing interests her (except hiding) and one game I taught her to play. She doesn't care about other dogs, really, either. But she likes to chew, so finding something that lasts a long time and keeps her engaged is a godsend.

"Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2023","Kenzie","yes","yes","Hard but brittle","My dog Eugene chews like it's his full-time job, so we're constantly experimenting with products that will last more than an hour for him. This product was recommended by word-of-mouth to me which is always a good sign, and I think after he devoured it in less than an hour I have some insights. This chew is very hard, it would be great for medium-strength chewers. However it's also brittle, so Eugene was basically breaking chips off of it and eating it like a candy bar. Additionally, the price point is a little steep for us given how long it lasted. Eugene is also not food-motivated at all, which makes him the ultimate connoisseur, and this was to him pretty tasty but nothing to write home about. Collectively it took him not very long to get through it but he wasn't so enthusiastic that it was all in one sitting. At one point he opted to go chew a stick in the grass instead. So, take what you will of that, my dog is an anomaly in a lot of ways but for us we will keep looking for his ideal chew.

It keeps her occupied for maybe an hour or so (she's a light chewer, so if your dog is a heavy chewer, this likely won't last more than 10 minutes). When the chew gets to be small (potential choking hazard), you can soak it in a glass of water overnight, and then pop the chew into the microwave the following morning for apx 30 seconds to 1 minute (wait for the chew to ""pop"") and then when it cools down, you can give it to your dog as another little treat. I'd recommend giving this chew to them outside, since the smell of it (post-microwave) is not pleasant. Take note - when you place the chew in the microwave, it should become much larger than what you put into the microwave. If it's not, then it's still a choking hazard for your pup.Long story short, these chews are great, our (samoyed) dog loves them, and there are options for still using these, even after your dog has chewed them all the way down to a small nub.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1HBAQ9U0JF4UZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B081LYFK6W","B001J9SUHG","Flavor Name: Cheese | Size: 3.3 Ounce (Pack of 1)"

"Reviewed in the United States on April 3, 2023","Gnatty77Gnatty77","yes","yes","READ THIS BEFORE BUYING!!","I’d read about these yak chews and thought I’d give them a try as a last resort of sorts since my 10 month Basset hound goes through bones like crazy. She loves to chew but nothing lasts. She either eats the bone within minutes or tries to eat the ones that aren’t edible (nylabone type) and I have to take them away and throw them out which is a waste of $. I wanted something that would last a few days but also not splinter or cause indigestion or dental issues. And preferably, little mess. I purchased this pack of 2 Himalayan Happy Teeth yak chews (pb flavor) to try. First, let me say that she loves them. No problems w the flavor. But she ate it within 15 minutes, at most. These aren’t cheap and I’d hoped to get more for my $. At least a day! I was disappointed but upon further inspection of the back of the package and comparing it to the other large, single pack (original; 4 oz) & small 4-pack of chews I bought (churro flavor w chicken; 4 oz), I noticed a scale on the back of all of them. I saw that this pack was rated on the lower end (2). The other bag (same company) was rated an 8. Had I seen this before I made my purchase, I’d have ensured to get a harder density bone. The size DOES NOT have anything to do w how dense the bone is so don’t assume larger is harder. The scale will help you decide what’s best. It is extremely helpful in allowing owners the opportunity to pick the right yak chew just for your pet. If you’ve a large, senior dog w dental issues or weak teeth, pick a large, softer chew. If you’ve a small dog or a puppy who’s teething, pick a smaller, softer chew. Or anything in between! Since my medium sized dogs teeth are large, I’d prefer a large, harder chew (I’m sticking w the 8) until she’s an adult. I’m wondering how many people who said the bone didn’t last purchased them w out referring to the scale? So please read the entire back of the package to get a better idea of what will suit your dog. Let’s keep in mind that it’s almost impossible to find an edible YET SAFE bone that will last very long. That’s just how it goes w animals w big, sharp teeth that chew everything so I use common sense when comparing and rating. I don’t expect to get what I didn’t pay for but I do expect to get my moneys worth. Here’s what I learned. This feedback was based on a medium sized, 10 month old dog w no dental issues. The small chews that were rated 2 were gone in a few minutes while the large chew rated 2 lasted 15 minutes. The large chew rated 8 on the scale lasted 2-3 days. She chewed it for 8 hours straight, stopping only to sleep, when she first got it around 3pm and on/off throughout the next day and finally finished it by early evening on the 3rd. All that was left was a little 1.5 inch nub. After researching, I learnt that the nub can be soaked in water for 5 minutes then microwaved for a minute or so until it puffs out. (Watch it as it heats and take it out when you think it’s about to pop.) It’ll feel light w the texture akin to a pork rind. Once it cools, (it WILL be hot), you can let your dog eat it. It’ll be very crunchy and they Will absolutely love it!! After microwaving the nub of the yak chew (8), the result was similar to the non microwaved yak chew (2). I think that’s how they soften them so that they can be rated lower. Be warned, any chew that’s 8 or above will be very hard and dense. Impaction/breaking a tooth/choking would be my only concern w these chews but that goes for just about everything a dog chews. Owners should always maintain a watch over their dog while they chew on bones. I’d suggest a large chew for larger dogs because they won’t be able to get it totally inside their mouths and that’ll slow them down. Even if it’s an 8 on the scale but smaller, it’ll still fit in their mouth where all their teeth can work it into nothing in no time. I haven’t seen any issues w diarrhea or digestion since my dog has been eating them, but I’d check w your vet about how many is the right amount per week. As for mess, the softer the chew, the messier it seems though the churro flavor wasn’t too bad. This particular yak chew, Happy Teeth (2), stuck on my carpet but was easy to pick off w my fingers though the vacuum did no good especially once the crumbs dried. The (8) made hardly any mess at all but for the random crumb here or there. Best for the softer ones to be eaten outside or on a surface where the crumbs can be easily cleaned. I highly recommend this brand of Himalayan dog chew. Just don’t forget to check the scale before making your purchase. FYI: There are yak chew/bone holders available that aid your dog in keeping it in a position that’s easier for them to chew using a screw and prevents them from choking on the small piece. (The entire thing is very hard plastic.) Once the chew is a nub, you can remove it and microwave. They’re kind of expensive ($18-30) but I found one, Bonehead, for $5 w the available coupon. It only works w the larger bones-you might check for other holders for smaller bones-but did an excellent job of allowing my dog to grasp and gnaw on her yak chew. It also gave me peace of mind that she wouldn’t swallow or choke on the nub.If this was helpful, can you please hit the thumbs up button on the bottom!

Our pup devoured the last bone in a day. Even though the labeling is for a 55lbs & under. This cheese bone has lasted longer than the other brand. My pup is 88lbs and it has been a struggle to find appropriate chew toys. This bone must have a higher density of the ingredients or the processing is better.

Dark brown on the front side and the sides were collapsed in (all the moisture gone, I guess). I gave them to my dogs anyway - with a close eye on them. The first bites shattered the chew into 1"" chunks, which never happens with this brand. Total choke hazard as these pieces were just big enough to put in the mouth but then didn't break down as fast. Also had a very strong smell when chewed which was worse than the usual Yak cheese smell. (We get yak cheese chews a LOT so I'm used to the cheesy odor)I took these away.

She loved the taste, and it’s a pretty tolerable smell if you don’t mind stinky feet cheese.  She’s a labrabull and definitely has a strong jaw but these treats do not last as advertised.  I’ve found a good alternative in buying PR rinds from a local market and microwaving them into puffs.

Initially, we loved them (she realllly loved them!). We were always a little concerned about the potential of a choking hazard (pieces being bit off, as our dog frequently did). Yesterday, our dog started vomiting - and a lot! It lasted through the day. This morning, she was much worse. Not eating and not even drinking water. She became weak and couldn’t even walk. When we took her to the vet, they did x-rays and saw that she had an obstruction. We ended up having to do surgery because of how bad it was. My dog is literally in surgery right now. The doctor just called us and told us she had a piece of this bone stuck in her stomach!! We’re out $1700 because of this bone. I’m so mad right now. Had we not taken the proper steps, the doc said she wouldn’t have made it. I will not ever purchase one of these bones again. I saw so many reviews saying similar things and I’m kicking myself for not listening. Do not buy these bones!!!!

Changed my review to three stars because my dog did enjoy it quite a bit.I was really excited for this as a replacement for the nasty smelling bully sticks that my dog loves but also burns through. When I got it out of the package it smelled nice and felt really firm and I had high hopes. My dog loved it! She chewed on it off and on for about two hours throughout the evening. Only made it through about 10% of the chew, so she hadn't digested that much of it.  At 2:45 in the morning my dog is crying loudly and barking in her crate, which she has never done before. I took her outside to potty and she had really bad diarrhea. I told her good girl for making it outside, offered her a drink of water and put her back to bed. I woke up at 5:30 to get ready for my day and i heard her very quietly whimpering. She had puked in her crate at some point also, and then had more diarrhea outside.

"Reviewed in the United States on October 7, 2017","Aineadele","yes","yes","Dog LOVES it, but a little dryer than past experience. Possible choking hazard.","I have a 15 lb, 11 month old schnauzer puppy-and he's a huge chewer. This dog gets into EVERYTHING. Never had a dog that destroyed so many toys, so quickly. Had to stop buying stuffed toys almost completely, as he tears off pieces of fabric and swallows them-or more recently, sawed off one of his teeth by trying to eat a strand of string he torn out of a toy (I was mortified and threw the toy away. It barely lasted a few minutes before being destroyed.) I now search for toys that offer a challenging chew factor while still giving him the satisfaction of feeling like he destroyed it (he seems to mostly be interested in things he can tear up, and ignores toys like nylabones or other inedible chews).Himalayan chews offer him the joys of both chewing heavily and eating the toy. I love this idea because it actually occupies my dog for extended periods of time, giving me peace of mind to relax, instead of chasing him around the house scolding him for stealing toilet paper rolls and tissue from the trash cans, or clothing from the laundry, and leaving trails of debris everywhere.When I saw this on Amazon, I got so excited, because the price was great. I recently bought a smaller one at the store called YakyChew, which my dog loved and ended up being awesome for him. The chew from the store was about half the size, and cost about the same, so the idea of getting twice as much chew for the same price was nice.However, this larger chew ended up being dryer than the previous store bought one. The dryness enabled my dog to chew a small piece off of the chew, which posed a choking hazard. As my dog loves to swallow pieces of his toys, this was not good. I immediately threw away the small piece, and now he will be supervised more closely while finishing this chew. I liked the smaller one I bought in the store before, due to it being more chewy than this, while still being hard and offering a definite chewing challenge to my dog. My dog was not able to chew off pieces and safely chewed it all the way down to a nub. I would recommend Himalayan style chews in general, but this particular one was too dry. It may have been a dryer batch, or maybe it's the consistency of this variety/brand. Just be careful to watch your dog if you order, especially if they like to swallow pieces of things. I may go back to buying at the store.",3,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RF3WW3768RN08/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B081LYFK6W","B001J9SUHG","Flavor Name: Cheese | Size: 3.3 Ounce (Pack of 1)"

She LOVED the chew. Like seriously obsessed with it. And before I purchased I did a couple hours of research to see if it was safe. After purchasing though, I had a couple concerns:1. She chewed quickly. She's not a super aggressive chewer irnfood obsessed. But she loves cheese (hence, she was ecstatic about the chew). She chewed a full inch off in about 30 minutes before I took it away from her. I guarantee if I left it with her it would've been gone in less than 3 hours.2. The chews are VERY hard. I think too hard. And like I said, my dog has all her adult teeth in. I don't think the dogs saliva breaks down the chew fast enough for it to not be too hard on their teeth. Fortunately it didn't break through to the pulp, but it did cost us a vet visit and a dental work with anesthesia to smooth the tooth over and seal it to prevent any future decay or tartar buildup. ($600)3.  Even when microwaved, the chew was still too HARD. I thought it was super cool that you could microwave the chew and make it into a crunchy treat. But even still the treat was too hard for me to feel safe giving it to my dog. Especially after the chipped tooth incident. I opted to microwave the remaining chew, after it was immediately removed from the microwave, cut it into small chunks while it was still a little warm and pliable, and then soak the chunks in water to soften them up. It still took 3-4 hours to partially soften each piece. I even had one piece I soaked overnight and had to throw a portion of it away because it was still rock solid like a pebble.Overall, my dog loved the product, my vet, wallet, and sanity did not. I do not feel comfortable leaving this chew with my pup, surpervised or not.A broken molar is simply not worth the risk. Especially so young!

My internet research suggested: Benebone, Himalayan Dog Chews, Pig Ears, Bully Sticks and Hooves/Horns/Antlers.  I have a 45lb black labrador.1) Benebone – my dog likes her benebone but it only keeps her attention for about 10-30 minutes at a time.2) Himalayan Dog Chews – my dog loves these!  They are expensive, but they don’t have a weird odor.  One large chew lasts for about a week.  She will spend a couple of hours per chewing session (approximately 6-10 hours per chew).  Unfortunately they are about as messy as the pig ears, and she leaves little bits of Yak cheese flakes.  When they get small, I microwave the remaining pieces for 30 to 45 seconds.  They puff up and make a quick crunchy treat (but a huge mess).  I have tried purchasing these from both Amazon and Petsmart.  Amazon is cheaper and the quality seems to be better.  (One of my Petsmart chews broke in half almost immediately after the start of a chew session).  *Update: I have stopped giving these to my dog because they frequently break in to small hard chunks, and I worry about my dog choking.3) Pig Ears – my dog loves these!  Made in the USA (of course)!  They are messy and they smell.4) Bully sticks – male cow penises.  I hear good things about these chews.  However odor is an issue, and they are expensive.  *Update: These are my new favorite dog treat.  They smell like smegma.  However, they are not messy, they keep my dog busy for a few hours and my dog loves them.5) Hooves/Horns/Antlers – I saw several negative reviews from people who had to pay for extensive dental work after giving these to their dogs.

It's not too hard for his teeth (note: he's a careful chewer, but can chew through a rawhide pretty quickly) and it doesn't get slimey like the rawhides do. I'm also a vegetarian, so giving him these over a rawhide makes me feel much better personally. The only downside is that they're a bit pricey, but the one  I've gotten has lasted for weeks (with plenty more to go) where the rawhides I've given my pup have only lasted a week or so. I would 100% recommend getting these.The chew I received was 4.5in long and 1.5in thick and looked pretty similar to the one in the picture.",5,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71V15ANVlYL.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R26UY3PXKAPD4T/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B081LYFK6W","B001J9SUHG","Flavor Name: Cheese | Size: 3.3 Ounce (Pack of 1)"

I need something that will last longer but not splinter like bone or become a choking hazard like other products, or be made of ingredients that are not natural or healthy.

They destroy ""extra durable"" nylabones so quickly and eat the plastic chunks, so those are out. Bully sticks are more healthy, but for these funny shaped dogs they just won't work - they were chocking on the big, stringy pieces they were getting off. We tried deer antlers, and were reasonably happy with them - but as the dogs age, I was worried that they were a bit too hard. A friend of mine posted a photo of his dog with his ""himalayan bone"" and I was intrigued. He said this lasted his big lab/pit mix forever - which I hoped would translate into my dogs not being able to destroy it the first day.Positives:Natural material - so safe for dogs to eat the pieces they get offOnly can get off small pieces - no worries about choking on bit-off piecesDoesn't smellDogs love themThe last chunk can be microwaved for a quick/safe treat - instead of throwing it awayNegatives:If the dogs were left to their own devices with this treat, they would have it gone in a day. We give it to them for an hour at a time so that they last and so that the dog didn't just get a 1/4 lb chunk of cheeseThey are a little messy - so don't put them on something you can't easily clean.

I love that they are digestable and seem soooo much more healthier and safer than those Nyla bones. No watching for those plastic pieces your dog or pup could swallow! Although you do have to be a little careful if small chunks breaks off, as it can be a choking hazard. But other than that, these are great. And the best part is once you do find a small chunk or after the chew gets gnawed down to that small size, you can microwave it for a nice biscuit like snack! My dog doesn't  LOVE these like some other things, but she does enjoy it and it last a long time so it becomes more like a go to chew when she is bored. My pup tends to use these for shorter chew sessions.***Originally gave this 4 stars, only because my pup didn't seem to like it at first, but as they chew on it more it becomes softer and I guess more appealing. She still doesn't go after it like crack lol, But all the other benefits still make this worth it and I foresee me buying a lot of these in the future!",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3BVIBP7DTIZBM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B081LYFK6W","B001J9SUHG","Flavor Name: Cheese | Size: 3.3 Ounce (Pack of 1)"

"Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2015","John","yes","yes","Satisfying but Short","My girlfriend and I have two Australian Shepherds, which are notorious for their high energy. For about the past year, we have used nylabones to help them focus some of their energy at times when we are both busy. Now, this product obviously tries to differentiate itself from the rest in a number of ways; and for the most part, it excels in those ways, but it has some drawbacks of its own.I'll hold off on writing out an itemized list of the pros and cons, and just make this short. Basically, this product only satisfied part of what we were looking for. We didn't like that the Nylabone tends to ""shred"" and cause the dogs to choke on the small bits, and sometimes even cut their gums. These chews definitely did not have this problem. The main downsides are that it's kind of smelly, which I completely expected it to, and that the dogs went through them in a couple of days. Well, really, one dog stole the other's when he'd finished his own, so each chew only lasted about a day. And that's really the other main reason we decided to try this.So overall, I'd have to say that for the price of about $10, and for it to last only a day, I can't see us buying any more of these. For that kind of price point I feel buying a rubber chew toy, or a bag of treats would be a better value.  I could see this being a good purchase for some, though. Perhaps our dogs are too ""chewy"".",2,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMLS7NE09VLLM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B081LYFK6W","B001J9SUHG","Flavor Name: Cheese | Size: 3.3 Ounce (Pack of 1)"

He ended up going home with prescribed food and digestive medications as well as an injection and antibiotics. Needless to say, my dog will never be given this treat again.

I give this three stars instead of two stars, because my other dog who doesn't do bones, rawhides, or other chews, enjoyed the microwaved end piece.

However, my dog gobbled up half of it within 15 minutes and I eventually took it away from him because he was eating it too fast. On the plus side, my dog enjoyed the dog chew, unfortunately about 6 hours later (in the middle of the night) he woke us up whining. We took him out and he had horrible diarrhea. The diarrhea continued for the rest of the morning.

"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2013","🔹 Catrinka 🔹","yes","yes","Not a good choice for aggressive chewers...but a delicious option for those dogs who savor their chews","You would think that between a 110 lb dog and a 16 lb dog, the big guy would be the most destructive chewer, right?  Not so in our household.Our huge German Shepherd loves these Himalayan Chews every bit as much as our little terrier.  But he holds his gently between his front paws and carefully works on it, softening the chew so that he can scrape off bits of it.  Even this way, he can get it down to a nub in 3-4 hours.Our small terrier, on the other hand, isn't allowed to have these anymore.  For starters, this is the only chew or cookie that she's SO crazy about that she'll try to attack her huge brother shepherd (who she normally loves) to try to get one of these away from him.  Not a good plan...he's patient with her but that only goes so far.  As far as chewing it, she's always been a very aggressive chewer and can demolish one of these quickly.  Because of that, I worry about choking on large chunks and no longer allow her to have them.  This means that the big guy can only have his under supervision.  Otherwise, she'll go racing over and attack him, grab it, and race away before he even knows what hit him.  Then we have a very disproportionate dog squabble on our hands.**IMPORTANT NOTE: Never seal up an already-chewed Himalayan Dog Chew in a plastic bag.  It's important that they dry out between chewing sessions so that they don't get bacteria or mold growing on them.  Since I generally give my shepherd a chew for just an hour or so at a time, he doesn't finish it all at once.  I simply put it up somewhere out of his reach so that air can reach it.What I really like about these (besides my shepherd's enthusiasm when he gets one) is that they don't really get stinky like bully sticks and many other long-chew options.  I also like that this is a Fair Trade product. They're produced by a consortium of about 900 farmers in Nepal using their own yaks and cattle.If you're interested in more details, the company's website goes into detail about how they are made.  In a nutshell, the milk is boiled for hours, then hand-cranked in a centrifuge to remove the fat, then coagulated with lime juice and salt.  The solids are then washed free of the lime and salt and squeezed in burlap bags for weeks to remove the moisture.  Finally, they're cut to shape and strung on rope for drying/cooking with sun and smoke.  The end result are rock-hard chews.  One bit of information I found interesting is that the top 10-15% are taken and marketed as dog chews.  The remaining 85-90% are used for local human consumption.  I keep telling my dogs that they've got it better than most people.  Now, if I could only get them to read this as proof.All natural ingredients: yak milk, cow milk, salt, lime juice.  Contains no chemicals or preservatives.",4,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R9ZOS9NYWTEZT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B081LYFK6W","B001J9SUHG","Flavor Name: Cheese | Size: 3.3 Ounce (Pack of 1)"

At first we really were thrilled with these. Our dogs just loved them so much. Also, these last a long time (if you only allow your dog to have access them for limited intervals of time) if you are able to have them all day they will go much faster.It seems not every bone is created equal. The batches all seem different. I have two dogs and there seems to always be one bone that they are very interested in and another that they just won't touch. It isn't that my dogs just want what the other one has because none of them will touch it.It always seem that the one that they are interested in seems to go a lot faster (like it's softer) Maybe it is easier to chew? The one that they didn't want seems to look like it was burnt during the baking process? I don't know. We bought four bones, two of which were highly desired and two that were not. We read that if you soak them in water or broth they will be interested again... this did somewhat work but we had to soak them frequently in order to maintain interest.These chews are pretty pricey, and I want to buy them again I just would like to see more of a consistency in the chews. I think the ones that are burnt are just too hard for my dogs and they hurt them to chew on them (their teeth were bleeding:() So I don't blame them for not being interested. It's too bad because they highly recommended on other sites and I like the benefits that the chew offers to my dogs for their overall health.

Quint","yes","yes","Dog loves it, but not long-lasting","From the description one would expect this would be more along the lines of a bone as far as length of time it would take to wear down.  As other reviewers have noted, however, this wasn't the case.  Unlike some reviewers whose dogs demolished it in an hour, ours (a 40 lb Portuguese Water Dog) did get 4 chewing sessions from it (a total of maybe 2 hours), with the end of each session being of her choosing.  I opted for the large size rather than the medium because it seemed that the medium size was the one where reviewers reported dogs encountering trouble from pieces breaking off.  Small pieces did break off but they were small enough to not cause any problem, and my hunch is that the greater diameter of the large size chew takes care of some of that tendency.  As far as reports of digestive problems from ingesting pieces, our dog encountered none, despite the fact that she has a somewhat sensitive stomach.  One odd thiing that happened was that in handing her the bone after it was half eaten, it dropped on the tile floor and broke completely (and cleanly) in half! As far as buying them again, if the chews were less expensive or lasted longer, I'd probably get them with some regularity. As it is, I think the only time I might buy them would be for our twice yearly cross-country drives,when we could reward  her with it at then end of a long day of being stuck in a car.",4,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GPJO8W4LEDW0/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B081LYFK6W","B001J9SUHG","Flavor Name: Cheese | Size: 3.3 Ounce (Pack of 1)"

I imagine even he does eat them but he just doesn't run me over when the box containing them arrives.  I have to always look for deals and bargins because they are a bit costly, but considering how much treats cost, and that I have had to stop giving chicken jerky, well in fact all treats from China that doesn't leave me with a lot of options. Plus it isn't calorie laden and one of our little guys has become pretty chubby since arriving at our house last year. I think the coolest thing though is how you just pop the little pieces that are left behind (little 1/2 inch pieces) in the microwave for 37 seconds and you have yourself a yaky puff.  I just have to save the puffs until I get at least 4 for the little dogs so we don't start anything.  The one downside, aside from the cost, is that they can be noisy when it is lights out. One of our guys decides he wants to go to town on one of the large ones just as we all get tucked in for the night. Then I have to get up and walk around and pick them all up so he can't get to any of them and put them up for the night or I would never get to sleep. Oh, one more con, if you step on them barefoot, ouch. But again, the pros definitely outweigh the cons.

"Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2012","geoffory","yes","yes","Great clean treat","ATTENTION: Don't throw the treat away as others have, read below:I first learned of this treat from a booth at the Portland Pet Expo, and it has turned out to be an excellent, safe chew for our golden retriever puppy. When we first gave it to her, she absolutely loved it and chewed it for 15+ minutes straight, which was quite an attention span for our then 11 week old puppy. The pet expo sold samples at a discount, but said the retail price for this size chew was ~$24, so I was glad to find it on amazon for so much less.The himalayan chew is a combination of cow and goat cheeses, which is smoked for 7 months to produce a very hard chew which softens with puppy slobber. It does not stain, smell, or splinter. The only potential risk is a choking hazard as the chew gets small (what bone doesn't have this risk?). However, we learned a trick at the pet expo that most people here don't know:DON'T throw away the treat. When it gets so small you worry about choking, take it away and let it dry then microwave it for 10-15 seconds. The small chunck will get 3+ times larger, and will be less dense as a result. Now it is safe again to give to your pet as a quick treat. This way there is no waste, and your pet enjoys every last bit of it.EDIT: I have noticed it takes more like a minute in the microwave to fully expand. Your results may vary depending on the microwave power - just keep an eye on it and stop when it is no longer expanding.Now that we have had two himalayan chews around the house for five weeks, our golden isn't quite as crazy about it as when we first got it, but she will still happily chew it over most of her toys and treats, and she hasn't finished either one yet. She still won't chew it for more than 15-20 minutes at a time, so it has time to dry out and harden again between chewing sessions. For larger dogs and more agressive chewers, I would expect that it wouldn't last nearly as long since it will stay softer as they keep chewing for longer times.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RS7JS6P1C9X2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B081LYFK6W","B001J9SUHG","Flavor Name: Cheese | Size: 3.3 Ounce (Pack of 1)"

They are amazing and you can't beat the free shipping from the suppliers on Amazon!  My search for a long lasting chew started when our lab/doberman puppy was only about 3-4 months old.  I had read so many good things about bully sticks so I ordered them and then just about threw up when I smelled them!  I tried to look over it, gave it to our pup (who loved it) but then not only did it smell while he was eating it, but his breath was stinky for a while afterwards!  Plus, I'd say the bully stick didn't seem to last much longer than a regular (non-stinky) rawhide.  Then I ordered the Himilayan dog chew.  He wasn't sure how to approach it since it is literally rock hard.  But, then he started scrapping it with his teeth.  He isn't the type of dog to take big bites so he's never gotten any big hunks off of it.  One chew last weeks since we usually save it for an after dinner snack/entertainment (1-2 hours at a time).  Not only does the Himalyan dog chew last a really long time, it also barely smells at all unless you hold it to your nose!  And, at that, it's just a smoked gouda type smell so it's not repulsive like a bully stick.  Plus, it seems to keep our pups breath smelling much better than if he doesn't have it!  We had actually taken a Himalayan dog chew with us on a road trip to my parents house and their dog (9 year old lab mix) actually snuck into our bag and stole the cheese!  This is actually a very surprising thing because their dog has NEVER been a chewer.  If given something hard, she actually just hides it and never eats it.  So, to see her take the cheese and bite small pieces off, I knew she must have loved it!  On our next visit I made sure to have an extra piece of cheese just for her.  Needless to say, I cannot recommend trying this out enough!  If it ends up your dog didn't like it, you just tried one more item in an attempt to make them happy.  If they love it though, you will have found a great investment in your dogs health and happiness!
